    <h1>The Social Contract</h1>
    <p>The social contract is an idea formed by <a href="john-locke.html"><b>John Locke</b></a> that explains the transfer of power that is needed for a stable government. The contract states that free people should give a portion of their power, and freedom to a central government in return for protection. The people are given the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of property by the government.
