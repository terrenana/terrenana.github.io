    <h1>Trail of Tears</h1>
    <p>The Trail of Tears was a mass relocation of many <a href="native-american.html"><b>Native Americans</b></a> tribes starting in 1831. As part of <a href="andrew-jackson.html"><b>Andrew Jackson</b></a>â€™s Indian removal policy, the Cherokee nation was forced to give up its lands east of the Mississippi River and to migrate to an area in present day Oklahoma. Other native tribes left their homes willingly such as chicataw Indians. The Americans used the taken land for plantations and other industries. The continuous movement of the Natives was named the Trail of Tears due to the amount of pain that the natives endured. During the Trail of Tears about 4000 Cherokee Indians died.
