    <h1>Popular Sovereignty</h1>
    <p>Popular sovereignty is a concept that first appeared in 1850 while trying to organize the new american states of new mexico and Utah that had been acquired from Mexico. The concept states that individual states of the U.S should be able to decide whether they will be slave states or free states. Popular Sovereignty was first used by an Illinois senator by the name of <a href="stephen-douglas.html"><b>Stephan Douglas</b></a> in the Kansas Nebraska act of 1854 , which repealed the prohibition of slavery north of 36°30′ (established in the <a href="missouri-compromise.html"><b>Missouri Compromise</b></a> of 1820).
