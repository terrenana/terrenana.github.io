    <h1>Shays' Rebellion</h1>
    <p>At the end of the revolutionary war, America was in debt to France. France wanted their money in gold, but the wealthy merchants of America had only paper money. The merchants turned to the poor farmers for gold, even though they had none. The merchants were taking the farmers' land because they couldn't get gold to pay. This all came to a head in 1787 when <a href="daniel-shays.html">Daniel Shays</a> laid siege to an armory. The guards of the armory shot and killed 4 people. The rest fled.
