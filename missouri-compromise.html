    <h1>Missouri Compromise</h1>
    <p>The Missouri compromise was a law that stated all states below the line 36°30’ were to be slave states, and all states above the line were to be free states. This was instituted because of the land purchased in the <a href="lousiana-purchase.html"><b>Lousiana Purchase</b></a>. At first glance, it may seem the north is getting significantly more land. However, this latitude line extends infinitely. The south thought they could extend all the way down to South America, which means that they would get more states, and more Senators.</p>
