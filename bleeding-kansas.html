    <h1>Bleeding Kansas</h1>
    <p>Bleeding Kansas was a series of violent civil confrontations in Kansas territory, and to a lesser extent in western Missouri between 1854 and 1859. It emerged from a political debate over whether slavery should be allowed in Kansas. Many people from both free and slave states rushed to Kansas to claim it under their respective beliefs. Whoever won would be granted 2 more senators in congress. Men set to the streets in skirmishes where many died. </p>
