    <h1>Free Soilers</h1>
    <p> Free soilers were people that believed in anti slavery, but not because they cared about the well being of the stlaves. The free soilers were farmers who simply wanted land to farm on. They became annoyed that the richer people took up so much land for plantations that there was none left over for the poorer farmers. Due to the insufficient amounts of land, free soilers were antislavery so that there could not be large plantations operated by slaves.
