    <h1>Andrew Jackson</h1>
    <p> President Andrew Jackson was the person to propose the Indian removal act which soon led to the <a href="trail-of-tears.html"><b>Trail of Tears</b></a>. He was elected in 1828 where he became the 7th president of America. Andrew Jackson also gave a state of the union address in 1830 talking about Americaâ€™s attitude towards the native americans. Andrew Jackson wanted to relocate the natives to make way for settlers. He believed that the natives should be able to have their own government as long as they stay out of the way of the settlers. According to Andrew Jackson, moving the Indians would separate them from immediate contact with the settlements of the whites, free them from the power of the States, enable them to pursue happiness in their own way, and would stop their slow extinction.
