    <h1>Cotton Gin</h1>
    <p> The cotton gin was a revolutionary, yet simple invention made in 1793 that revolutionized cotton plantations. Before the cotton gin, slaves would typically have to handpick the seeds from the cotton. Then the cotton gin was invented. The design consists of a cylinder that spins and removes the seeds from the cotton. The invention was created to lessen the amount of slavery in the U.S however, it did the exact opposit. Now that cotton was easier to farm, it became much more profitable. Cotton plantations began to spread even more rapidly which in turn, required more slaves. The number of enslaved people rose with an increase in cotton production, from 700,000 in 1790 to over three million by 1850.
