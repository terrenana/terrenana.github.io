    <h1>Lewis and Clark</h1>
    <p>Lewis was an explorer and Clark was a military man. They were tasked by <a href="thomas-jefferson.html"><b>Thomas Jefferson</b></a> to explore the newly acquired Virginia territory in the west so that it could be settled by americans. Lewis gave speeches to the natives they encountered explaining that the settlers were coming. He would explain that they should abide by the rules of the president and their new “father” in order to continue to survive as a people.
