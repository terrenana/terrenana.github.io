    <h1>Senators</h1>
    <p>Senators were representatives from each state that got votes in congress. Each state was able to have 2 senators. Senators were very important in <a href="sectional-tension.html"><b>Sectional Tension</b></a> because if the south wanted control they needed more states which meant more pro-slavery senators. The same goes with the north who did not believe in slavery. The concept of senators was also very important in <a href="westward-expansion.html"><b>Westward Expansion</b></a> because the north and south needed more land, to make more states in order to have more senators. The north and south would continuously move farther west creating more states that supported their ideas.
