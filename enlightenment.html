    <p>A period where a series of ideas formed in the 1700s. These ideas sparked thinking beyond god that is more reasonable in terms of science and logic. Many of the ideas included in the creation of America are enlightenment ideas. God no longer becomes the main aspect of thinking. Now, many enlightenment thinkers such as <b><a href="/john-locke.html">John Locke</a></b> help to advance ideas and ideals of thinking about a greater future for America.
